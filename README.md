# Real-Time-Satellite-Imagery-Dissemination-Website
This project consists of a combination of APIs by which the user is able to visualize the data  by using various tools like excel, python and R. The user can also get the data to include  image file, image data, and image metadata for a particular day or date. From that date the  user has the data in the form of image and detail about the image. 
. Introduction 
The website will provide a user-friendly interface for the data visualization of the dataset in  different forms. The user will be able to visualize the data about Earth, like weather,temperature, and pressure. We are going to create a website that shows the astronomy pictures for a given date. On the website, we are creating two different pages for astronomy images and data visualization for the user, which is easier to understand in terms of the image detail and the data set. It will provide the content of various events that are held on different days. To find your NASA Picture of the Day for your birthday or if you were born before, simply go to our website's calendar archive.
Methodology/Planning of the Project work- 
 We will collect the data about the earth's weather in the format of temperature, 
pressure. 
 We were developing an interface that links the API and makes the data 
available. 
 When constraints have been met, resources must be gathered. 
 These procedures will involve website design, i.e., the type of visualization you 
desire, such as a 2-D effect, pi chart, bar graph, histogram, scatter, or histogram. 
 To visualize the data, we were applying a regression model. 
 We're going to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML to build a website. 
 In order to make the page more interactive and user-friendly, we were building a 
dynamic page. 
 We were creating an interface to link the API. 
 We're going to use the free source NASA API to get help linking the data 
through API. 
 The last part comes here in the assembling part of both the pages, to make the 
website user friendly and easy to use.
