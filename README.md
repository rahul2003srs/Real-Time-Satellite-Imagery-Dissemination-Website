# Real-Time-Satellite-Imagery-Dissemination-Website
This project consists of a combination of APIs by which the user is able to visualize the data  by using various tools like excel, python and R. The user can also get the data to include  image file, image data, and image metadata for a particular day or date. From that date the  user has the data in the form of image and detail about the image. 
. Introduction 
The website will provide a user-friendly interface for the data visualization of the dataset in  different forms. The user will be able to visualize the data about Earth, like weather,temperature, and pressure. We are going to create a website that shows the astronomy pictures for a given date. On the website, we are creating two different pages for astronomy images and data visualization for the user, which is easier to understand in terms of the image detail and the data set. It will provide the content of various events that are held on different days. To find your NASA Picture of the Day for your birthday or if you were born before, simply go to our website's calendar archive.
